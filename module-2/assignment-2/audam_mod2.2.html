<h1> Assignment 2.2 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2 </h1>

<h2> Chapter 2: HTML5 Layout </h2>

<p class="intro">My name is Mike Audam and I take great pleasure in science and equally inclined toward technological innovations. I also enjoy exercising, traveling and getting to know about people, new cultures and languages. Apart from traveling or immersed in reading, I also enjoy watching soccer quite a bit from the Scudetto (Series A - premier division) to the MLS and entailing elite teams like AC Milan, Inter Milan, AS Roma, Fiorentina or similarly LA Galaxy, Real Salt Lake, DC United among others. On the other hand I also enjoy watching King of Queens and Seinfeld when time allows.</p> <br/> 

<p>Particularly, in terms of Seinfeld, it is a popular TV show that ran for 9 seasons with around 180 episodes. Many Seinfeld episodes are based on real-life experiences reinterpreted for the characters' storylines. The series was often described as "a show about nothing". </p> <br/>

<p>Much of the show's humor is based on repeated use of irony, incongruity, and coincidences which had played a significant role in its success across several seasons. Seinfeld remains one of the most appealing sitcoms and still popular today. <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld>[wikipedia]</a></p> 

<p> While the above remain highly fulfilling hobbies, it is not always easy to find enough time to pursue those. However, <span class="sentence"> it has become an initiative to prioritize a work-life balance and more effectively manage time allocation to prevent burnout and enjoy other aspects that promote a healthy life journey </span></p>
